what type images are those based powder bed fusion additive manufacturing context?,"The images shown appear to be from a study or analysis of support structure generation methods for powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing processes. In PBF, parts are created by selectively melting powder material using a heat source, such as a laser or electron beam, layer by layer. Support structures are often necessary to anchor the part to the build platform, support overhanging features, and dissipate heat.

Here's a brief explanation of each method depicted in the images:

(b) Normal based method: This likely refers to a method of generating support structures based on the normals of the surfaces of the 3D model. Surfaces with normals pointing downwards or at significant angles may require support to prevent the part from collapsing or warping during the build process.

(c) Image-based method: This method may involve using 2D images or slices of the 3D model to determine where support structures are needed. The algorithm might analyze each layer and determine the best placement of supports based on the cross-sectional area and the geometry of the part.

(d) Support detected by SCNN: This could refer to a method that uses a Spatial Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) to detect areas that need support. SCNNs are a type of deep learning model that can process spatial data, such as 3D shapes, and are useful for tasks like object detection and classification.

The teal-colored part in each image is the 3D model to be printed, and the red structures represent the support structures generated by each respective method. The differences in support structure configuration highlight the various approaches and algorithms used to optimize support generation for additive manufacturing."
