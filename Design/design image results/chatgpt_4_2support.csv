what type images are those based powder bed fusion additive manufacturing context?,"The images shown are based on the context of powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing. They appear to depict the process of creating a three-dimensional object with PBF technology, where a laser or another type of energy source is used to selectively melt and fuse powder material layer by layer to build the final object.

From left to right, the sequence of images represents:

1. A schematic or digital illustration of the intended object (a dinosaur in this case).
2. The initial layers of the object being printed, illustrating the unfinished state and the support structures often necessary in PBF processes.
3. The completed object still in the powder bed, where excess powder has not yet been removed.
4. The object after the excess powder has been removed, showcasing the completed print in its raw form.
5. The finished object after post-processing, which may include cleaning, curing, and other finishing steps to achieve the desired final properties and appearance."
